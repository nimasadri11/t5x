what are building blocks of nucleotides 	 Nucleotides are organic molecules that serve as the monomers, or subunits, of nucleic acids like DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). The building blocks of nucleic acids, nucleotides are composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. Thus a nucleoside plus a phosphate group yields a nucleotide. 	 1

what are building blocks of nucleotides 	 Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. The monomer itself from ribonucleotides forms the basic building blocks for RNA. However, the reduction of ribonucleotide, by enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), forms deoxyribonucleotide, which is the essential building block for DNA.There are several differences between DNA deoxyribonucleotides and RNA ribonucleotides.Successive nucleotides are linked together via phosphodiester bonds.he general structure of a ribonucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a ribose sugar group, and a nucleobase, in which the nucleobase can either be adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil. Without the phosphate group, the composition of the nucleobase and sugar is known as a nucleoside. 	 0

Mass number is simply the number of nuclear particles (protons and neutrons). Atomic mass is the actual mass of the atom. Keep in mind that protons and neutrons do not have masses of exactly one amu. Even if they did, the mass of the nucleus is not the sum of the masses of the nuclear particles. There is only one isotope of one element for which the mass number and atomic mass are exactly the same. That is carbon-12, and happens because the amu is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. 	 0

when does mass effect come out 	 Best Answer: Mass has inertia directly proportional to the amount of rest mass. So increase the rest mass and the object's inertia increases. Decrease the mass and it's inertia decreases. Some would say that rest mass is a measure of inertia when the object is at rest...not moving. But that's not necessarily the case in relativistic physics. 	 0
